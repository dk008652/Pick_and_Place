1. creating workspace (catkin workspace commnad)
2. create kuka_arm package with some dependencies (look package file for dependencies)
3. source devel/setup.bash (or update .bashrc file for permanent solution)
4. build package(catkin build //catkin-tools required if not installed than install it first)
5. add urdf file in the kuka_arm/urdf folder with meshes files in meshes folder(kuka_arm/meshes)
6. create launch files in kuka_arm/launch folder (for clarification if robot spawned in gazebo or not/ "pgain not found" error can be ignored)
7. create moveit package (follow moveit documentation) 

# Be cautious, finger joints(gripper) have effortJointInterface and link joints have PositionJointInterface.
8. create pid gain file and load into parameter server.
9. create control files for both gazebo package and moveit package. 

ros_controllers.launch
{
1. commenting ros_controllers.yaml 
2.adding controllers.yaml 
3.adding gazebo_controllers.yaml
4. "arg" parameter modified (args="joint_state_controller arm_controller gripper_controller"), no other parameters are modified.


}

10. 
$ sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-ros-control ros-noetic-ros-controllers
"ros-control installation"
http://wiki.ros.org/ros_control

11. kuka_arm_moveit_controller_manager.launch.xml file of kuka210_moveit/launch file modified 
this file used to upload ros_controller.yaml file to parameter server, Now this .yaml file changed by controller.yaml (resides in kuka210_moveit/config directory).


12. now create .world file to launch world in gazebo

13. Adding objects into gazebo: Quite simple yet difficult, add model file into .gazebo directory, create world file by adding world tag and naming it as a .world extension. this .world file reside in world directory of kuka_arm package.

14. Adding a node in any package and modification in cmakelist file
how to run that node?
solution: create a launch file to launch newly created node.   

15. Adding a header file and changes to be made in cmakelist.txt
{include_directories(include ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS} ${EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIRS}) , this added into camkelist.txt file}
